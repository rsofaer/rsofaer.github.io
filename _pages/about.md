Hello!  I am a Computer Science PhD student at the 
Columbia University [Software Systems Lab](https://systems.cs.columbia.edu/).

I'm interested in reducing the cost of robust software through formal
verification and program analysis. My current projects involve improving the
management of dependencies in dynamic languages like Python and Javascript and
verifying Linux kernel components.  In the future, I plan to work on enabling
formally verified components to be incorporated into the kernel as living
code, with proofs that can be practically maintained as the kernel changes.
